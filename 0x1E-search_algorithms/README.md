## 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms Project on the concept of C and Algorithm
### Search Algorithms
The concept uses search algorithm to find specific elements within a given
problem space in the most efficient way.
###
Time Complexity and Space Complexity
The search algorithms have different time and space complexities.
The time complexities are denoted using the Big O notation of which
entails maximum theoritical run time and computational complexities.
